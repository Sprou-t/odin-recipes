       <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>MAKING THE FILLING: Ricotta Filling#1: In a large bowl, blend all filling ingredients together until smooth, set aside filling until needed.</li>
            <li>Ricotta Filling#2: In a large bowl, blend all filling ingredients together until smooth, set aside filling until needed.</li>
            <li>Beef and Spinach Filling: Brown beef and veal in butter with the whole clove of garlic.</li>
            <li>Remove garlic and let meat mixture cool.</li>
            <li>Mix spinach, parsley, eggs, cheese and nutmeg into cooled meat until well blended, set aside filling until needed.</li>
            <li>Sausage Filling: Brown sausage in frying pan, drain fat and allow sausage to cool.</li>
            <li>When sausage has cooled, mix in eggs and cheese, set aside filling until needed.</li>
            <li>MAKING THE RAVIOLI DOUGH: Sift flour and salt together.</li>
            <li>Place flour mixture on a board, making a well in the center of the flour.</li>
            <li>Drop eggs into the flour well, using your hand or a fork, break the yolks and beat eggs slightly.</li>
            <li>Combine the eggs and flour together, gradually adding enough warm water to make a stiff dough.</li>
            <li>Knead dough well, until smooth; cover the dough and let it rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut dough in half and roll each half of the dough out on a floured board, into a very thin sheet (about 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick).</li>
            <li>FILLING THE RAVIOLI: Drop about 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoonfuls of filling about 1 1/2 inches apart all along the dough.</li>
            <li>When the sheet of dough is fully dotted with dabs of filling mixture, cover filling with other sheet of dough.</li>
            <li>Using your fingers, gently press dough between each dab of filling to seal it.</li>
            <li>Cut ravioli into squares with a (zig-zag edged) pastry cutter, or very sharp knife.</li>
            <li>DRYING THE RAVIOLI: Allow ravioli to dry for one hour before cooking.</li>
            <li>COOKING THE RAVIOLI: Drop ravioli into 6 to 8 quarts of boiling, salted water and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until dough is tender.</li>
            <li>Remove cooked ravioli from pot carefully with a skimmer or a large slotted spoon, and drain well.</li>
            <li>Place drained ravioli on a serving platter in layers, alternating layers with your favorite sauce and a sprinkling of grated cheese between each ravioli layer.</li>
            <li>Serve Hot</li>
